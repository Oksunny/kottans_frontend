Task 0 

I have finished all the tasks that where asked. I enjoyed the cource of How to Use Git and Git Hub and I have finished the try.github.io. I believe the Version Control System knowledge is crucial for every developer and it definitely will be useful in future.

 I'm glad I'm joining the course.
